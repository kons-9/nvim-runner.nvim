code runner for nvim					*runner*

1. usage		|usage|
2. future work

==============================================================================

1. usage

Please enter :Runner, and you can run file.
Default setting is written in setting.toml.

g:exectorMap is dictionary.             *g:exectorMap*
Default is 
let g:exectorMap = {"cpp":"g++ -std=c++11 -o $dirNoExtention $dir && $dirNoExtention","rust":"hello rust","python":"python $dir"}
for example, if filename is tmp.cpp, the command may be
    g++ -std=c++11 -o tmp tmp.cpp && tmp

You can use $dir and $fileNoExtention etc...

g:extentionMap is dictionary.           *g:extentionMap*
Default is None.

example:
    When you want to add extention, like .ml, 
    g:extentionMap["ml"] = "ocaml"

2. future work
* import user defined toml file 
* import user defined json file
* add :DebugRunner
